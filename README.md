# Destreza-Redux
Gave myself 1 week to rewrite an old project from scratch.

Notable Improvements: 

Input System - using the new Unity Input so we can use any type of controller relatively worry free.

Book Page Effect : Scenes look and fold like the pages of a book using render textures.

Netcode Ready : Wrote the character logic with rollback net code solution in mind.

Overall flexibility: gameplay tuning is handled via animation events to allow the designers maximum control. 
Variable settings like stock count and power-ups are also easily added.
